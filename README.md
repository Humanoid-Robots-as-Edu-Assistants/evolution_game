### How the Game works

This game serves to loosen up the lesson a bit. It can be done with any number of students. <br>
The students spread out loosely in the room. The robot NAO then briefly explains the game.<br>
After that, the exercise starts.<br>
The aim is to win 3 times and thus reach the highest level. Whoever has achieved this <br>
sits down and waits until the others have also finished.<br>
Meanwhile, NAO stands in front of the class waiting for someone to play with him. <br>
To do this, tap one of NAO's sensors. Then he asks the player to choose one of the three cards infront of him.<br>
On each card is a NAO-mark. These stand for rock, paper or scissors.<br>
The player shows the chosen card to the robot. <br>
Internally, NAO has also chosen one of the three variants.<br>
It tells the player who has won. Then the robot waits for the next player. <br>

### What do you need?

In addition to this program on your Nao, you also need 3 cards.<br>
They must show your chosen NAO-marks and what the card represents (rock, paper or scissors).<br>
If you don't want to create this yourself, you can use the "cards" image in the files and print it out.

### Plans of further development:

Sometime in the future, it is planned that Nao will recognize the player's hand position<br>
with his camera in real time, making the gameplay more natural.
